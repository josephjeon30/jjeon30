QCC:
* Why does the browser download foo when we go to localhost/static/foo but not when we go to localhost/static/foo.html
* Can we replace 127.0.0.1 with the word localhost and get the same result?

DISCO:
* Opening link in browser gives an "Unable to connect" error
* Opening page after running app.py shows the same "No hablo queso!" page
* adding "/static/foo" on the browser will cause it to download the file foo
* adding "/static/foo.html" on the browser will cause it to not download the file foo.html but it will read the html file, showing the text "Is this plaintext, though?"
* fixie.html acts very similarly to foo.html
