Time Spent: .5hrs

Predictions:
* print statements will show up in the browser
* return statements will show up in the terminal
* request.args['username'] would work if there an username established

QCC:
* What does the "*" symbol mean in HTML?
* What do print(app) do?
* What is the ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'srjntr,umf'), ('sub1', 'Submit Query')])?
* Where does the "Submit Query" come from since it's not in the html file or python file?

Disco:
* When html runs <form action="/auth"> (when we click Submit Query) it runs the route in the python file
* When submitting a username, it shows up in the link
* Uncommenting line 41 creates an error, "BadRequestKeyError"
