v1 removes print(__name__)
	this prints "__main__" in the terminal
v2 adds print("about to print __name__...")
	this prints in the terminal
v3 adds app.debug = True
	this causes text about debug to print in the terminal when the file
	is ran
v4 adds the if statement if __name__ == "__main__"
	app.debug and app.run() will only run if this is true, which it
	has shown to be true.
